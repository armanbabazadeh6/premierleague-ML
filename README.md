Premier League Match Outcome Prediction Bot

This project focuses on building a machine-learning model to predict the outcomes of Premier League matches. The bot is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages various data science and machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast match results. Below is an overview of the key steps and tools used in the project:

Project Overview

	1.	Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
	•	Loaded and cleaned match data, including datetime conversion and categorical encoding.
	•	Engineered features such as venue codes, opponent codes, match hour, day of the week, formation, and referee encoding.
	2.	Model Selection:
	•	Utilized the RandomForestClassifier to build a robust prediction model.
	•	Applied hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model’s performance.
	3.	Hyperparameter Tuning:
	•	Employed RandomizedSearchCV for efficient hyperparameter optimization.
	•	Defined a comprehensive yet streamlined parameter grid to explore various configurations of the RandomForestClassifier.
	4.	Cross-Validation:
	•	Implemented k-fold cross-validation (with k=10 and k=15) to ensure the model’s reliability and generalizability.
	5.	Handling Class Imbalance:
	•	Applied Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance in the dataset, ensuring that the model performs well across different classes.
	6.	Model Evaluation:
	•	Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.
	•	Compared different models and parameter settings to select the best-performing model.
	7.	Experimentation with Other Models:
	•	Explored alternative models like XGBoost for potential performance improvements.
	•	Tuned hyperparameters for XGBoost using RandomizedSearchCV.
