This project is a machine learning bot that analyzes and predicts outcomes of Premier League matches. The bot is built using a Jupyter Notebook and employs various data science and machine learning techniques. Here is a brief overview of the steps involved in the project:

Overview

	1.	Data Loading: The Premier League match data is loaded from a specified source.
	2.	Data Preprocessing: The raw data is cleaned and preprocessed to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.
	3.	Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance accurately.
	4.	Model Training: A machine learning model is trained on the training data to learn patterns and make predictions.
	5.	Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test data to measure its accuracy and performance.
	6.	Prediction: The model is used to make predictions on new or unseen data.
	7.	Results Visualization: The results are displayed using various visualization techniques to provide insights into the model’s performance and predictions.

Tools and Libraries

	•	Python: The programming language used for the entire project.
	•	Jupyter Notebook: An interactive environment for developing and presenting the code.
	•	Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
	•	Scikit-learn: Provides machine learning algorithms and tools for model training and evaluation.
	•	Matplotlib / Seaborn: Used for data visualization to better understand data distributions and model performance.

Installation
